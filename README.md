The "Task Board" System
“Task Board” is a simple information system for managing tasks in a task board. Each task consists of title + description. Tasks are organized in boards, which are displayed as columns (sections): Open, In Progress, Done. Users can view the task board with the tasks, search for tasks by keyword, view task details, create new tasks and edit existing tasks (and move existing tasks from one board to another).
You are given the RESTful API + Web client app + Desktop client app + Android mobile app client for the task board system. Your assignment is to write API tests and UI automated tests for the system.
